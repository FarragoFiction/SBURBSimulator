<h1> Vague Todo List </h1>
Without making any promises (and in no particular order), here's a vague list of my future goals in relation to this project.  It's highly likely that at least some of the things on this list will never actually happen.
<ul>
	<li> Give AuthorBot a highly indulgent self-insert into the simulation. If shit gets weird, she can help debug. She is so great.</li>
	<li>Take advantage of shareable sessions.
	<Br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Isn't this a mystery??? This is actually what I'm looking forward to most of all. Thus I will be an enigmatic bastard, cause I don't want to talk it up too much and then disappoint  everybody if it turns out to be boring or impossible)  </li>
	<li> Have a character creator mode. (Customize all players, and then let sim run) </li>
	<li>Make GodTier aspect backgrounds better. They are so bad.</li>
	<li> Have Trickster scenes. </li>
	<li> Joke squiddle sessions </li>
	<li> If jack is driven off by at least one god tier, he destroys the moons (one at a time).  players might stop him first, though. destroying moon kills all dream selves that aren't main selves.</li>
	<li> Upgraded hair sprites (karmicRetribution is helping me with this) </li>
	<li> Obligatory highly indulgent author self-insert. </li>
	<li> Actually keep track of relationships, so I can treat infidelity differently.</li>
	<li> Jack stab corpse images (little knives sticking out) </li>
	<li> Maybe more stuff with exiles or carapacians other than Jack/Mayor. PM needs some screen time</li>
	<li> Have a as-spoiler-free-as-possible Homestuck refresher page linked from the about page</li>
	<li> Have AuthorBot have a spoiler free page, and a stability page</li>
	<li> more claspect specific events sylph of time does different things than a bard of time, for example.</li>


</ul>
