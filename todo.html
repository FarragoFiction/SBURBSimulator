<h1> Vague Todo Pile (never stops getting taller) </h1>
Without making any promises (and in no particular order), here's a vague list of my future goals in relation to this project.  It's highly likely that at least some of the things on this list will never actually happen.  Many of the things on this list have been influenced by the whispers of the horrorterrors (that's you guys, btw).  Bold means I'm seriously likely to implment this 'soon' (often because it seems easy and would make the sim way better).  Thanks to <a href = "credits.html">aspiringWatcher</a> for tiding up this stupid pile. Italics means partially complete.<Br><Br>Also: <a href = "https://trello.com/b/NcjvAYie/sburbsim"> Here's a public trello board so you can see what I'm doing</a>
<ul>
	<h1>Immediate Plans (~1-3 months)</h1>
	<li>Secret rendering update <span class="void">Gonna make 'rendering type' a field on oc data strings, adn have whole pools of different sprites you can use. Homestuck, mlp,eggs, adults, etc. </span></li>
    <li>Consort/Carapacian companions (enable pages to do quests without another player, among other things)</li>
    <li>Midnight Crew Shenanigans</li>
    <li>Tier 2 Sprites and DreamSelfSprite GodTiering (definitely post fraymotif)</li>


<h1>Long term and vaguer plans</h1>
    <h2>The cosmetic changes (Graphics, texts, etc)</h2>
        <li>background images for lands</li>
        <li>Thanks for Playing image</li>
        <li>Trollian window</li>
        <li>Pesterchum status, afk, available, away, etc. Effects odds of convo, or convo can be 'can we talk later? kinda busy.', even if they were tryign to start up an important side quest, like exiling jack</li>
        <li>Don't use "the" in boss fights (i.e. know if you're fighting a player or a gameEntity)</li>
        <li>Refactor graphics AGAIN to take advantage of hardware acceleration and/or improve god tier rainbow effects.</li>
        <li>Map paradox space initial conditions. Infinitely scrolling. </li>
        <li>Generate a working troll title for each session at the end of it. It would be so dumb and pointless. I love it.</li>s
        <li><i>SVG graph of player power over time (x is ticks, y is power) color coded. (Why are graphs so awesome? What is WRONG with me?) Could happen at end of session when MVP prints out. Or be it's own page. or something. would need to record power...okay, figure this out later.</i></li>
    <h2>Classpectry and Time bullshit</h2>
        <li>Special page where AB can test yellow yards for me/give Observers advice on what to do</li>
        <li><b> Additional means of manufacturing doomed time clones.  (time player's crush gets in a relationship, whoops, nope, never happened). Lets time clone armies happen from things other than ectobiology failure. BUT, when time players do this, chance of marking the session as doomed. Doomed sessions will NEVER breed a full frog. Shenanigans will prevent it.  Sign of an irresponsible time player.</b></li>
        <li>Void/Light players less likely to be targeted by bosses</li>
        <li>Using reckoning meteors as weapons during queen/king fight for certain claspects. </li>
        <li><b> Flavor text when tiem player is the one killing the ectobiologist/space player and causing a bunch of doomed time clones. (thnx astronomyenthusiasist)</b></li>
        <li>Allow time to be broken. Divs for story are randomized so things happen out of order. Can I make it happen only after a certain point??? How obvious will it be?</li>
        <li>If need to make claspect effects rarer, lock them to god tiers only. </li>
        <li>Certain claspects can get into time conversations with themselves, like Karkat did? (Huh, if karkat's self-convo's were claspect related, was it because Blood tried to effect the 'relationship' with the person on the other end, but reflected it infinitely making it glitched? Probably over thinking this....)</li>
        <li><i>More claspect specific events sylph of time does different things than a bard of time, for example.</i></li>
				<li>if a session is gonna be a combo session (presimulation bullshit), can access faq written by next universe players. causes one player that normally wouldn't "know about sburb" to know about sburb.</li>
        <li>Claspect Metas-shenanigans, like reading GameFAQs</li>
    <h2>The Replaying</h2>
        <li>follow Glitch FAQ closer. <a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=13g_YxAgDyjwpGr1osn9ObAWnsWBXXEf86DDI5da1gVI">aspiringWatcher compiled a summary here</a></li>
        <li>Fanon claspects if/when canon claspects are unique enough in sim. aspiringWatcher was nice enough to collate a list of GlitchFAQ <a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cCEwdC0NDWWWFWrEitoM9lL80s8_N_xqPweA2B2ojhA">classes</a>/<a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m1DhAwSAgno1ADZTUyoJzI4oe1sra58B_XOWUZK1jDI">aspects</a> and their tasks.<span class="void">And "tax" aspect after a Discord-in joke.</span></li>
        <li>Easter egg 1 player session (either space or time.)</li>
    <h2>Plot Bullshit</h2>
        <li>SERIOUSLY pre-simulate a session before starting to display. Will let me grab out moon visions and fate. If I let the session CHANGE based on fate things get weird tho. Like, there will be this hypothetical version of the session that PRODUCES a sentinet First Guardian, but then they use their knowledge of the session to modify it enough that they DON'T get produced? wth? Maybe in cases like that it hardcodes the FirstGuardian to be what happens postScratch?  And if the FirstGuardian fails to make the session scratch, it's a doomed timeline?  Sounds neat.</li>
        <li>More procedural ending. If Black doesn't defeat White, players can try to launch meteors themselves. </li>
        <li>Possibility of prototyping something pre-entry that makes Queen's RING OF ORBS XFOLD completely useless, like the armless doll from Paradox Space</li>
        <li>Heal land corruption (rerolls corrupted land part) </li>
        <li>Skaia quests for post denizen players</li>
        <li>Have everybody defeating their denizen be a prequisite for deploying the frog. multiple chances at fighting the denizen. or at least have enough grist be required.</li>
        <li>Have death in combat be an Important Event</li>
        <li>Make Reckoning not based on number of ticks, but on plot shit. </li>
        <li>Direct horrorterror presence. Everything goes crazy, reality warps.  Reality randomizes for a few turns (species and claspect can change, relationships, triggerlevel), before being restored. will have to have a save state. (maybe my cloning system?) </li>
        <li>GrimLight corruption.</li>
        <li>Ironic Zombies</li>
    <h2>Of Players and Dialogues</h2>
        <li>Standalone quirk generator</li>
        <li>Update dialogue engine. Starting to show it's 'age'. </li>
        <li>Pesterchum moods mapped to triggerLevel. Only displayed if Rage players (like a subtler version of shipping grids)? </li>
        <li>Players can try to have denizens kill Grim Dark players (but only their own denizens)</li>
        <li>Memos. And if I'm feeling especially masochistic, transTimeLine memos</li>
        <li>Consider having a consort or carapacian companion be available for players. Only way poor Page of Space without a Knight friend can ever breed a frog. available in fights, too.</li>
        <li>Trickster bed?</li>
        <li>One of the characters can be discovered to have been secretly a robot all along.  If discovered, nothing changes, except they now look like a robot. In dialog, mention turing test passing ftw. </li>
        <li>Godtiering through dream self sprite (gets prototyping fraymotifs as well)</li>
        <li>Players can do dream bullshit even if they shouldn't be. addiction?</li>
        <li>Tier2 sprites.  Can be used as backup lives (if player is permadead, but there exists a sprite form of them from any source, they get shoved into the party? Have "sprite" added onto title?).  Refactor sprites to be 2 vars instead of one.  Chance of tier2 prototyping before entering session, buffs the enemies 2x.</li>
        <li>Dream self goes rogue and/or evil. Regular player loses access to having a dream self back up life until resolved. Can still get to GodTier with a Rogue dream self, though. (philosophical conundrum: are you sacrificing your life so THAT ASSHOLE can be a god, or are you stealing their body?) </li>
        <li>Rainbow drinkers?  Jade blood revives as one instead of using up a dream self? extra power</li>
    <h2>NPCs</h2>
        <li>Putting really stupid shit in your tier2 sprite. Like the Black Queen. Or Hephaestus. Just. Really stupid shit. What would even happen? </li>
        <li>Corrupt denizens and royalty</li>
        <li>Adult guardian shenanigans. </li>
        <li>Allow dear sweet, precious The Mayor to be a source of Drama. Sorry, The Mayor... </li>
        <li>Jack gets a combo session power boost (He is the cancer, it is him)</li>
        <li>If jack is driven off by at least one god tier, he destroys the moons (one at a time).  players might stop him first, though. destroying moon kills all dream selves that aren't main selves.</li>
        <li>Captchacard monsters</li>
        <li><b>Exile scenes for characters with particularly low free will. </b></li>
        <li>Quest for creating your session's First Guardian. ('random' components) If sentient, First Guardian orchestrates their own creation. Can also spin off other side quests with good or bad intent, or influence them to scratch WITHOUT waiting for user input (not like, temporally, but other ways of recovering the session, like combo or yellow yard would be disabled.) Make them a GameEntity like Jack/Queen/King/WV/PM?  Sentient FirstGuardian makes ectobiology less likely preScratch.  </li>
        <li><b>Extra side quests.  Courtyard droll blows up Prospit/Derse's moons, for example. Or HeartsBoxcar gets heavily involved in shipping.  Diamond Droogs steps up to be second in command if you exile Jack, and he seriously boosts the queens power, etc. etc. </b> </li>
        <li>Maybe more stuff with exiles or carapacians other than Jack/Mayor. PM needs some screen time. http://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/748185</li>
    <h2>???</h2>
        <li>Cueball themed debug view</li>
        <li>Have a as-spoiler-free-as-possible Homestuck refresher page linked from the about page</li>
        <li>Further upgrade AuthorBotJunior to allow filtering by classes/aspects.</li>
        <li>Have a tiny  database/local file running parallel to main site,  all it does is log page counts, at least at first.</li>
        <li>Joke squiddle sessions </li>
        <li>Random low, deterministic chance of one of the easter egg modifiers being applied to a normal session.</li>
        <li>Adult session.  Players have serious chatHandles, use SeriousBusiness instead of peseterchum. Just, so many hats. Significantly more stable romance. Significantly slower quest/power progress. No quirks, perfect punctuation/capitilization. If I wasn't fuck deep in refactoring claspects I would do this RIGHT THE FUCK NOW. Thanks anon!  Might just straight up make it a session modifier? </li>
        <li>shitty minigames <div class = "void">just like afterlife url, every land quest lets you click a link that takes you to a new tab to play a shitty mini game as the character and their partner doing shitty quests in their shitty land. so shitty. you can't even fight. everyone is disappointed. </div><li>
        <li class ="void"> more special sessions, like only alpha humans + trolls or beta humans + trolls. </li>
