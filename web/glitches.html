				Shit. Um. Were you part of a combo session? There's a known bug that certain types of time travel in combo sessions instead travel back to the version of the current session that WASN'T invaded by players from an alien session.   So you should see some familiar players, but nobody from the first session.  Hold tight, I'm working on it.

					!!! Oh god! Oh god! I FORGOT ABOUT YOU GUYS! Okay. So. Don't panic. But you guys were an easter egg I made. God that makes me sound like such as asshole. But...like...I overrode some players to be more ...well...'canon'. It never even occured to me that one of the easter egg sessions would get hit with my YellowYard! There's only like 3 of those things and roughly a 2% chance of a YellowYard happening! Jegus! So....when you went back in time, my mad science modifications were no longer in effect. The players you saw were...who you are were originally? Shit. Besides the baldness. That's on me. I preloaded the easter egg players, but not the originals. So any graphic assets that weren't loaded just didn't show up.
					<Br><Br> Bad news is, I...kinda don't think that you guys are a priority? Fuck. I'm REALLY sorry, but there are SO MANY FUCKING THINGS ON FIRE in this massive pile of glitches and bugs, I just don't think I can justify spending time fixing something that only effects a max of 3 sessions.  Most of the bugs I fix effect thousands at a time, you know?  And hell, as I tweak and modify the sessions, odds are the YellowYard won't even be AVAILABLE to you guys anymore so....problem fixes itself? Sorry that doesn't actually help YOU, though.

				<br><br>
				That's...weird. Okay, hold on, let me check. I don't THINK I'm re-killing players at any point. Hrrrm... and there's the code for time shenanigans to actually bring them to life... What the hell is going on....Oh god. Oh my FUCKING GOD.  I fucked up. Shit. I was sending you into a stable time loop. You were God Tiering the Heir of Doom from your doomed timeline. So. Um. I guess he's still back there, sitting in a pile of corpses and crazy people? Fuck. That might be more tragic than when it was just you stuck there. Okay. Things should be fixed. Next time we do this (which doesn't help YOU, just alternate time line yous), we should successfully go to the NEW timeline and bring back the non-doomed Heir of Doom.  Thanks for letting me know!

					<br><br>
					Okay, well, contrary to popular belief, players cheating on each other or flirting around isn't a bug.  I'm not about to enforce common courtesy amongst players. That's not how I roll.  BUT, I am fascinated to hear that you want to kill everybody three times.  That...that is not normal.  Huh. Looks like you're part of a combo session? I wonder if my generated relationships is bugged for combo sessions?  Bluh, I just realized that I'm more concerned that you want to OVERKILL your former friends, than the fact that you want to kill them at all.

					<br><br>
					Huh. That's weird. It kind of reminds me of another bug I had. That shit was tragic. I can see that I'm still not re-killing anybody. And...shit. Okay. Slightly less tragic, but related to the 'bringing the doomed version to God Tier' bug. It turns out I was accidentally-on-purpose making hollow puppets of the corpses you guys were supposed to be God Tiering. Each timeline gets their own corpse puppet. But since you were godtiering a puppet, that did nothing to the original player. And the puppets don't exactly get up and help out once they achieve God Tier. I promise I had a good reason for doing that!  Okay, it should be fixed.

				<br><br>
				Well, I mean, some sessions DO have the reckoning start pretty early, but you should at least have a LITTLE time between entry and the final fight. Let me look into it.  ... Okay.  Shit. I WANT to ask you if you're a scratched session, but I guess the whole point is you have no way to know that.  But I managed to track down a bug where scratched sessions weren't resetting their timeTillReckoning.  So the reckoning would happen pretty much as soon as it could. My bad. The bug is fixed, and the other timelines of your session should be doing better now. Sorry!

				<br><br>
				!!! Shit.  Okay. Reviewing your session it looks like the problem is that you were a scratched session. Basically, your guardians played the game first, (they were teens, and you and your friends were adults).  And they took care of the ectobiology.  So...when you tried to do the ectobiology, too, you created...sort of....doomed extra babies?  Shit. That's just extra tragic. It shouldn't even be possible, if you aren't destined to do ectobiology, then the equipment shouldn't even be IN your session. I'll look into it. Thanks for bringing it to my attention!

				<br><br>
					Huh. Well, I mean, MAYBE she is a clone? I'm totally making clones of all players who enter a foreign session.  For time shenigan reasons, don't worry about it.  But...the clones should be kept in stasis until time shenanigans need them....they shouldn't be running around. Let me look into it.
					<br><Br>
						!!! Whoops!  Sooo....good news is, I have totally tracked down the problem.  Bad news is, have you ever heard of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion"> Capgras Delusion</a>?  Basically...i accidentally sorta kinda gave all you foreign players brain damage. And...it made you THINK your former friends were all weird replacmeents when they weren't.  Turns out, when I was artificially modifying the clones to care only about each other (and not you original players), there was a sort of...sympathetic reaction and it modified you guys' feelings as well. So you thought the Maid of Hope was a weirdly familiar stranger.  If I HAD woken her clone up and shoved her at you, you would have thought she was your original friend.
						<Br><br>
					So....uh, while, as always, there's nothing I can do to help you, alternate timeline versions of you (and all players who go to new sessions) have you to thank for bringing this problem to my attention.

		<br><br>
		Huh.  I gotta admit, while I knew it was technically possible for two players to have not only the same claspect, but the same chat handle, I never expected to actually SEE it. And then you both level up at the same time and so try to use the same echeladder? What are the freaking odds? Thanks goes to qwedvj for bringing it to my attention.
		<br><br> So...like....I don't even know what to do here. Echeladders are labeled by chat handle. With the assumption that chat handles are unique within a session.  I could enforce chat handle uniqueness....but then that's picking a side as to which Prince gets to keep it. I could try to identify the echeladders more uniquely?  Bluh.  I'll fix this. don't worry.  (Also, can I mention how cute it is that the Princes of Time end up in diamonds with each other? Shout out to karmicRetribution for noticing.)

		<li>  <a href = "index2.html?seed=149309">Session: 149309</a> <b>burlyTrainer: uh... i am the bard of time and me and my friends were going to play this really cool game but as soon as i tried to do the kernel thingy the game crashed? what gives? </b>
		<br><br>
			Well, on the one hand, there are those who would argue that the only way to win SBURB is to not play at all...but I can see how a session so bugged it crashes might be a problem for causality. Let's see.... Wait. What the fuck!? So... you are the result of a SGRUB session that got a yellow yard, then scratched, then invaded another session (this time SBURB), then scratched again.  No fucking WONDER you're bugged to hell and back. Shit's complicated. Okay. Don't panic. I've got this.
			<br><Br>
			Huh, that's really weird. It looks like the SGRUB session handled their ectobiology before scratching...but then in the SBURB session they were created there as well?  Shit doesn't make sense, but ALSO would explain why doom got EVERYWHERE after that. Oh!  Okay, this is my fault. It turns out I'm setting the ectobiologicalSource for the current players, but NOT THEIR GUARDIANS, and so the game tried to create the troll guardians a second time (which also of course recreated THEIR guardians, which already had an ectobiologicalSource) and everything just sort of spiraled out of control after that.  I'm frankly amazed things didn't break until a second scratch.  The straw that broke the hoofbeasts's back turned out to be the fact that the troll guardians weren't REALLY supposed to be in your scratched session, and so the game just sort of gave up rather than trying to figure them out. (Who the fuck are these douchebags?)

		<br><br>
			Oh.  Fuck. Well, this is a good example of why the fuck I was cloning the players foreign to a session just in case of time shenanigans.  This is what happens when I DON'T.  Or rather, you are scratched players. Aaaand...when I did a YellowYard on you, you didn't reset, even though your session did. So you entered the session with full memory of how fucking fucked you were, flipping your shit and trying to murder each other and everything.<br><Br>
			I'm left with a dillema here. Part of the reason why scratched sessions go slightly differently than non-scratched sessions is they don't have to use seeds to re-generate players. So anything relying on randomness will play out slightly differently.   I can either clone the players post-scratch as well (with all the added complexity and Capgras Delusions that risks), or...I can make scratched sessions slightly more...reliable?  I could let the scatched sessions differ ONLY by who is playing in them, which, I mean, that kind of makes sense. Have the random stuff be the 'same' (even then, it probably won't be because differently players will do things differently, which will effect the seeds that way).  Bluh, I'm getting to technical. Don't worry, I got this.

			Huh.
			<Br><br> I thought I fucking fixed this already. Bluh, looks like the ever growing pile of glitches doesn't stop from getting taller.  Oh look, ectobiologicalSource stopped getting set for Guardians. Again. Bam. There you go, fixed. I swear to god, ectobiologicalSource better fucking STAY fixed or I will do an acrobatic pirouette of the handle and upgrade the AuthorBot to help me debug these stupidly convoluted sessions.  And current me is fully aware of how terrible an idea that is because these types of sessions just DO NOT FUCKING END. Current me is practically getting caught in infinite loops trying to debug it. Dear sweet precious, sweet, sweet AuthorBot would be lost forever if she tried to navigate them.

Not only is your very existance some sort of cruel joke, but you get like double the bugs of any other session. Okay. Well, the good news is that your guardians exist, so that you exist again.

			<br><br>
			Ordinarily I try to focus on the "leaves players to horrible fates" kind of bugs. But HOLY FUCKING SHIT, do I HATE how PNGs implemented gamma. Half the pngs I use are ...just....LOUSY with gamma. And it fucking turns out that not all browsers render gamma the same way. And SO, my code, which is looking for SPECIFIC FUCKING COLORS, can't find those colors in some browsers, some of the time. Luckily, I've figured out how to just fucking strip the gamma outta pngs.  As long as I remember to do it. Even if I think I don't need to.  So, yes, you are correct, prince hat-dealy thingies (you know, the tiaras?) were not getting their colors replaced correctly, and so were stuck in the default color of "Light".  It's fixed. And I sincerely regret that you guys are stuck forever in a shitty doomed session, but at least alternate versions of you don't have to do it with an eyesore.

*JR is surprised and excited to get a 12xBugReport Combo* Wow!!!  I guess I have no choice but to actually buckle down and fix your broken easter egg session, instead of just passing it on to future JR.


<br><br>



Hrrrm… AC11 (Hi Sollux!!!) definitely has a point. I only check for easter egg sessions when the page loads, not when a scratch happens. But I ALSO wasn’t actually making the guardians (you guys) right.  If I had let you actually get created, you would have not recognized each other as soon as you got into the session, and that turns out to be traumatizing enough to crash the session. For...reasons.  So I made the conscious decision to let you not exist as players. Especially since at the time, your Guardians weren’t actually failing at the session, and so you guys never even had a chance to find out you didn’t actually exist.

But, I went and added the new guardian system to the easter egg code, and you should be able to enter the session without insta-trauma.   Your 12x Roleplay combo was the push I needed to finally not be a massively lazy piece of shit.   The fix should even work for the other easter egg sessions.

<br><Br>
Also, about the other bug. Well. When I first started Nepeta Quest, the 12 Nepeta Easter Egg Session, I decided that I didn’t want a boring session full of identical trolls. So, my original way of doing things was just to let the nepetas overwrite the original players, but only superficially? That way they’d all be different, like a bunch of nepetas all roleplaying as the original players.  But if there were less than 12 players in the session, I’d create fresh players, and figured shoving a random easter egg troll into the slot would keep them from all being the same.

Somehow….apparently all 12 players were being created via the second way. So all of you were very noticeably the 12 easter egg trolls, and not the original players. Whatever. I declare this “canon”. 12 dead nepetas, all roleplaying as their friends, or 12 easter egg trolls all (badly) roleplaying as nepeta. Both are canon, simultaneously. I love it.  Basically the only thing that changes is either all the trolls have Olive blood, or they have the entire rainbow of blood, coresponding to which easter egg troll they are.

Wait. What?  Oh. Fuck me.  APPARENTLY, I decided to make denizen fights a once-a-session event. For SOME fucking reason.  Your Thief of Life got the event, so then it was ineligible for anyone else.

But that triples the god tier rate (gives players a new source of death besides just other players and Jack). Hurts the overall survival rate though.  Eh, time to stop rambling.

<br><br>
		You know, I HAVE noticed that a surprising amount of sessions just straight up have no frog at all. Like, not not ENOUGH frog, but 0% of a frog. (KR even quipped to me recently that the space player in a session they were debugging must have just been sitting around and eating chips). Looking into it...hrrm. It LOOKS like I'm locking out all players from doing their main quests in the begining. They are supposed to be enjoying the early game, doing bullshit puzzles and moon parties, not stressing out over the main quest, right? But SOMETIMES players never get out of the early game, which is to say, they never level up at all.  Looking into it, the sidequests level up the player doing it, BUT NOT ANYONE WHO HELPS THEM. And apparently some players are passive enough to always be helping, and never be in charge.  So you could get space players who never were a high enough level to even START frog breeding.
		<br><Br>
			Good news is it's fixed, and frog breeding should always at least start if the space player is alive and not just fucking around on the moon. Bad news is that somehow the Thief of Space in your session starting frog breeding made events spiral out of control until your leader forgot to do ectobiology. For...some reason. Sorry you ended up MORE doomed.

Yeah, SBURB really IS bullshit. I guess that fighting you, even failing at it, was enough to push them to the next level? SBURB is notorious for letting non-living things level up, though (hats, safes, refridgerators), so a corpse leveling up isn't that surprising. Plus, if/when they revive, it'd make sense that they wouldn't have sudden amnesia of your fight, right? So experience gained is experience gained.

  Holy shit do you guys work fast. You managed to exile the queen before the last player was even in the session!?  Major props.

My bad.
  <br><br>On a side note, I'm not gonna take your props away or anything... but I kinda just noticed that you were exiling a corpse...after Jack had already stolen the ring.  Huh. Better make sure you can't destroy a ring that's currently in the possesion of the stab-master.  I still maintain that corpse exiling is a valid tactic.

      Whelp. That’s what I get for blaming all my problems on ghosts like a superstitious oldtimey dude. Looks like the problem is that after a yellow yard, the fucking BOSSES ARE SPAWNING DEAD.

On a side note, it turns out the players COULD have submitted their own bug report..but I guess they decided that giant dead snakes spawning was a GOOD thing rather than something to bitch about.

  Huh. Who would have thought a bug would be so...canon?  Turns out that sprites were retaining information between timelines.  While that wouldn't normally matter (the tight lipped bastards) apparently it occasionally was enough to throw the timeline off, like in your case. So, Observers were using my YellowYard to tell you to do the same thing over and over again, because from THEIR perspective, you weren't doing it. You were CORRECTLY traveling back in time to the right timeline (along with those 100 other Witches of Time with their own corpses to GodTier), while the Observers would fuck off and view a slightly different timeline where the sprites were just a haaair more smug than usual.

      <b>maidenDirector:  Maid of Doom here. Thanks for, leik, apparently helping that alt universe version of me????????? And I feel leik an douchebag complaining after seeing what THEY went through...but...is there SUPPOSED to a never ending line of Black Queens to fight? Where even is the King?   </b>
      <br><Br>  OMG this is so dumb. I cleared away the "buffs" at the end of a fight to help your doppelganger, right? Turns out the fraymotifs were technically only "debuffing" hp...so when the fight was over...everybody springs back to life. Shit. I'm on it.

		<b>hauteBusiness:  Uh Heir of Breath here How is it fair that the Maid of Time got to START the game with such a fucking OP fraymotif They one shotted EVERYTHING  </b>
		<br><Br> Huh that's weird... Is it ONLY time players? Maybe it's a time shennaigan thing? Wait, no there's a Mind player over in this other session.... Wait. Fuck.  They were using their Time player's Instruments to do time shit.  Fuck.
		<br><br>Okay, I get it Time Players, time is the shittiest aspect, but STOP FUCKING SEQUENCE BREAKING!  Ugh...how do you even GIVE your past selves fraymotifs anyways???  Completely wrecked the balance. Fuck.
		<br><Br>The worst part is, once I do items, I pretty much HAVE to let you guys do this kind of shit with weapons. But I am drawing the fucking line at game abstractions like fraymotifs.

		<b>serenadingRapper:  hi there i just wanted to say that first of all our session was pretty screwed??????  like five of us have been in murder mode already and nothing very useful has taken place.  but the issue (and possible bug) is that when one of my friends tried to engage one of the murderers in a good old fashioned rap battle, the whole thing crashed!!  please fix this, rapping is the best!!!!!!!!  </b>
		<br><Br> Gasp!!! I wonder how long THAT has been bouncing around in there? Raps are clearly ALMOST as serious business as Shipping. Thanks for letting me know, I'm on it!
		<br><Br>Huh. Okay. Sorry for having such a unsatisfying response, but it turns out that the Observer who was visiting your session was....doing so in a weird way? They were using a weird browser instead of a sane one like Echidna or Typheus (I'm a Janus user 4 lyfe).  I shouldn't even be telling you this to preserve the sancity of the 4th wall. (lol). BUT, it's fixed now, and CLEARLY I will never have a browser bug again. I'm suddenly certain of it.

		<Br><br><b>cG</b>: UM, HELLO, KNIGHT OF BLOOD HERE. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH MY SESSION? FIRST, THE EMPRESS HERSELF SHOWS UP AND KILLS ME THE MINUTE I ENTER THE MEDIUM, ONLY FOR ME TO BE REVIVED MOMENTS LATER BECAUSE SOLLUX FROM THE FUTURE OR SOME SHIT SAYS I NEED TO MAKE BABIES. WHICH IS FINE, EXCEPT THAT THEN THE EMPRESS KILLED ME AGAIN, AND I GOT REVIVED AGAIN, AND THIS KEPT HAPPENING UNTIL I FINALLY MADE THOSE DAMN FUCKING BABIES.
        <br><b>cT:</b> D --> Heir of Void here. I have some grievances to air as well. As Karkat mentioned earlier, the Empress showed up, and I happened to be recruited immediately. But just as I was getting ready to grab some grist, all the Prospitians went crazy. Something about a Rage Virus? I don’t know, what matters is that the Empress recruited it to then collect grist for her. I didn’t know viruses could become tangible entities in such a manner.
        <br><b>cC</b>: Hi, Witc)( of Life )(ere! Really, t)(at Empress just caused all sorts of problems! Sea also recruited me to collect grist for )(er, but because sea’s apparently my ancestor, sea felt t)(e need to cull me? 38( But because I was recruited by )(er, I also tried to strife mys)(ellf? So t)(ere would end up being no battle, w)(ic)( I guess is good for me since t)(at means I didn’t )(ave to die. It )(appened a LOT t)(oug)(.
        <br><b>aA:</b> i guess every0ne had a pr0blem with this sessi0n. maid 0f time. y0u sh0wed up t0 help fix the sessi0n with y0ur magic ruler? well i decided the best c0urse 0f acti0n w0uld be t0 make karkat g0 g0dtier since as he stated earlier the empress kept killing him. but when y0u used y0ur ruler the sessi0n restarted with ab0ut 1/3 0f the 0riginal b0dy c0unt, and n0ne 0f the players even rem0tely resembled 0r acted like my friends. there was als0 a distinct lack 0f empresses in it t00.
<br><Br>
    so AA's bug is a known one, for whatever reason easter egg sessions just don't do jack shit....   I might wanna update )(ICs ai to not recruit ppl she's culling
<br>
rage virus being recruited is...hilarious, therefore it passes my standard for allowing a bug to exist...

(god my asshole creator meter is SO much higher than the last time i did one of these)

    WL: so hey...I'm the witch of life for my session (2522559, which combined with 610950961, which combined with 2269172892) and yeah. I've been through three sessions so far, and the bug is in the third one. there's a conversation between two players, and then SBURB/SGRUB/whatever it is at this point just bugs and crashes, pretty much killing us all. apparently something's wrong with the shipping grid? but it's been working fine through all the other sessions...help us, please.

    AO: Hey! I know as the observer, I'm not exactly supposed to jump in, but there's another thing that might be important. See, whenever I load this session, the page will randomly crash and reload, sending me back to the top of the page (which, given the length, is kind of frustrating.) It's possible it's my device (I'm on mobile, currently) but I've tried opening it into new tabs and two different browsers, Safari and Google Chrome, and it happens every time. It seems like it's just this session, too; I've run at least two other different sessions with no crashing.
    <br><Br>
    AO: (also, I apologize if I'm not supposed to send bug reports here. I'm not entirely sure where else to send them, though :P)

    Dammit. Why does Skaia take shipping so damn serious. The SECOND there's a problem with it and you may as well just crash the session. (No wonder that other version of SBURB removed shipping entirely...) BLUH. I'm on it.
    <br><br>...
    <br><br>...
    <br><br>Really.
    <Br><br>ONE fucking typo.  It wasn't about how it was a 3x session combo. Nothing to do with it being a custom session. ONE TYPO, and apparently only one Observer ever ran into it???  Like...apparently Heart players don't fail their Black OTPs that often. Cause the typo literally would only happen then. BLUH.  Fixed.  Congrats on making it into a 4x Session combo, and NEARLY a 5x (but you guys finally had enough survivors to not fit in the next session).
    <br><Br>Oh, right, and your browser refreshing in the middle of the session is just how some phones deal with really big sessions. I'm thinking of having combo sessions be 'opt in', where you gotta press a button to see the next session play out, to give browsers some breathing room.

  <Br>  Um, hi.  AB is weirding me out on experimental. Numbers are higher than they should be and people are surviving SBURB. The bugs are getting higher.
   <Br> I would ask ABJ what's happening except I'm never talking to her again after...
   <Br> The incident.
  <Br>  Involving a trickster ABJ, some devoured souls and robots saving everyone at the last minute.
  <Br>  So thank you and goodbye. I will resume cowering.
  <Br><Br>  -- sadisticCynic has fled. --
  <Br><Br>  -- sadisticCynic has returned. --
  <Br>  Ok this is purely an AB problem. I had a peek in one of the sessions and it was completely fine.
  <Br>  A little grimdark sure, but that's everywhere.
  <Br>  Here's the session I was talking about. <a href = 'http://farragofiction.com/SBURBSimE/index2.html?seed=3506833479&selfInsertOC=true&creditsBuckaroos=true'>here</a>

Hrrrm....I've changed too many things on my end to replicate the bug, but I'll be on the lookout for AB going shithive maggots.

Oh, shit. I made a typo.  Uh. Don't panic, I got this. But it turns out you were SO UNLUCKY that it took you 269 tries to defeat your denizen. My code SHOULD have found that and just declared you a loser, so you could at least rest, but I accidentally made it so you literally never could reach the turn limit. Sorry 'bout that. And. Uh. Also sorry about all that sarcastic clapping. Shit was unintentional, you just got a shit land.
