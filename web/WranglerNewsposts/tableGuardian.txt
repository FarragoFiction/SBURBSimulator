2019-11-17: Welcome to Main Branch, Carapace and Classpect update! May your balance be fair and your simulation times be brief!
2019-09-25: carapaces are complete!
2019-07-18: 2019-07-18: Carapace AI updates continue: WV grants his leader some rebellion members as strife allies, while AR grants something similar but in the form of police sidekicks.
2019-06-11: Muses no longer grant Pluck Tokens to nonplayers. I'd seen them grant pluck tokens to Jack Noir and the Black King before I patched this out. At least it's not like they could use them or anything.
2019-06-08: All current classes and aspects have been given an AI Scene Engine-based overhaul. Players can do sidequests (based on their class) to gain Pluck Tokens, which are used to fuel powers (based on their aspect). Additionally, our resident carapace cooks and collectors have been given minor adjustments. 
2018-09-03: You get AI! And <i>you</i> get AI! AND <i>YOU</i> GET AI! Everyone's going home with AI!<br><br>Yeah, so pretty much all the carapaces have AI now. Some of it is pretty basic, such as in the case of BE and AC. But as soon as I get my hands on Item integrated AI, they'll become a whole lot more useful.<br><br>As of the time I'm writing this, I have no idea how well all the different AIs will work in conjunction. Uh. So I'm hoping for the best. If the entire sim burns down when the AI switch is pulled, I give you my apologies in advance. But hey, it's a learning experience!
2018-08-26: SBURBsim, now featuring DEMOCRACY.<br><br>Also, everyone's favorite omnicidal carapace has a few more tricks up his sleeve. What could he be planning?
2018-08-24: Zero player sessions. They're <i>kind</i> of a thing. But where would you find them?<br><br>Also, Jack Noir may be teaching people do something stupid, but at least he's not teaching the same person multiple times over. Do you really want to know how many sessions I looked through in trying to find the source of that bug?<br><br>And for those of you who are worried, Jack will be back on his stabbing habit sometime soon. Once I finish up working on WV, Jack is my next target.
2018-08-21: AR now patrols the streets, looking to catch some crooks and criminals (literally anyone). If you end up in the slammer, don't worry. It won't be long before something lets you escape.(edited)
2018-08-18: CI and SI, the two Carapace inventors, now have their own scenes! Look out for all sorts of steampunk and gaslamp inventions in your sessions. I'll leave what happens when they get crowned up to you to find out.
2018-07-26: Gave some AI to MD. Her surgeries are not for the faint of heart. And if she gets crowned...
2018-06-21: Resident carapace Doomsday Prophet no longer confined to rambling in solitude. He can now ramble to you too. This is completely unsettling. I advise you don't listen to him. Especially if he gets his hands on a ring.
2018-04-20: Going on a bug hunt. To start, I found one that let carapaces survive scratches. Next, some strange name business was going on when players tried strifing for a ring. Finally, and this one I think is the best, blowing up planets no longer teleportalizes the loot of its entire population into your sylladex.<br><br> Funny story about that last bug too. When I first encountered it, it was all because a ringwraith had destroyed 2 sessions worth of dream moons only to die at the hands of a Witch of Space. Said Witch of Space took the ringwraith's inventory into their own sylladex and combined all the items. Yes, all of them. The resulting item, surprisingly, had a rank of -0.1. That's alchemy for you.
2018-03-22: It turned out that the cause of our opossum infestation was nothing more than a typo that treated the Black Queen as being alive while also being dead. Thankfully, this means I no longer have to hide my jarred fruit far from the reaches of their grubby little opposable thumbs
2017-09-27: Grist drops now contain 137% less JPEG-artifacts.
2017-10-26: Frogs for the Frog God. Heroes of Space who manage to produce a Genesis Frog will now be rewarded with a photograph of the moment they created it.
2017-11-19: Hope you like Alchemiters.
2017-11-26: It's table time. Operation "give every two traits a combo" is a-go. And it will be glorious. I guarantee it.
2017-11-27: Table production efficiency has increased by 230% since yesterday. More traits have been added to fill out the table.
2017-12-10: More table optimizations. Having to find names for these combinations is quite the mental exercise. All for the glory of the TABLE.
2017-12-13: Due to a small coding error, I was unable to guard my tables. This issue has since been fixed, and hopefully will never happen again for as long as I live.
