2018-03-07: Mail quests were originally envisioned as PM attempting to get various powerful objects from point A to point B, via points C, D, Y, V, and Ȍ͂ͭ. System was built around a single mail variable that would get pumped or dropped as she ran into various shenanigans.
2018-02-24: Originally, ringed Carapaces would have only the most minor of variations from normal behaviors- so, if, say, Clubs Deuce had the ring, he would continue to be a midnight crew agent, performing shenanigans with the POWER TO DESTROY PLANETS AT WILL. Gotta love that charming little bundle of potential mass genocide!
2018-04-19: Hell fucking yeah. This sort of emergent mechanic bullshit was exactly the plan when this baby was first designed. The more various universal mechanics you throw at the wall, the more insane stories like this you end up with.

2018-04-27: A Witch sat, alone, in an observatory, clouded by the impenetrable void. No light, no noise. Nothing but the broadcasts. Strange and occult lands, broadcast through the Furtherest Ring. Then, one day, a transmission. Not a land. A community. We’re so very glad that transmission got through.<br><br>  <a href = 'https://manicinsomniacmusic.tumblr.com/post/173344790258/'>https://manicinsomniacmusic.tumblr.com/post/173344790258/</a>
