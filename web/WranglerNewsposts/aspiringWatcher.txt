2019-11-18:  Go wild. Remember that players have an obsession with flipping a hidden coin and forswearing the new system if it comes up tails.
2018-03-17: I've prepared a comprehenisve list of Carapacians (variations not included) and you can see some snippets of it in the ShogunBot's card binder. Descriptions included. (You gotta flip the card turn-ways.) Aliases (community-submitted) randomized from session to session, but keep initials.<br><br> Every Carapacian has a Sway (Prospit/Derse) which determines where the Carapacian resides and Type (Geology/Cooking/Mechanics/Philosophy/Meme/etc.) which determine what the Carapacian does. <br><br>The Agents are an exception - they don't have lunar counterparts.<br><br><span class = 'void'> Current nefarious plans: * Convince JR to remove alias variety from Agents and Royals (until exiled) * Convince JR to make Seven Shanks a separate named carapace from Jack Noir (Note: This will equalize the carapacian types given that there are only 5 unique Derse and 6 unique Prospit carapacians (unique != "sway + interest", i.e. not agent/royal) - that is, Midnight Crew and Team Sunshine on Derse and Prospit respectively, plus (arguably) AR and MK.) because every goddamn noir city could use (from narrative standpoint) a Jack-the-Ripper rip-off serial killer.</span>
2018-01-26: Smiths are finally in. Now we can have more equipment.
2017-12-02: Zodiac shirts enabled.
2017-11-24: ...<span class='void'>Adversary system. For the wannabe serial player-killers.</span>
2017-10-27: Fan Aspect Gnosis ideas. Run the Numbers (Snow 4) is my favourite.
2017-10-17: ...<span class='void'>Whisperings. Can we have them.</span>
2017-09-13: Dream aesthetics are yellow and purple. Prospit and Derse.
2017-08-29: Grist. I hope it won't lead to a ton of doubles.
2017-08-10: More fanclasses. Now we have Graces, if you want MOAR cataclysms.
2017-07-25: ...<span class='void'>The Ultimate Riddle. Dare you seek it?</span>
2017-07-12: Aspect list determined and polished. Class list in making. Endings charted (for now...) and rechecked.
2017-07-11: ...<span class='void'>In ink and parchment, seek the riddles.</span>
2017-07-03: Yay. We have fraymotives. Perhaps one day we'll have procedural background for the players when they use them.
2017-06-30: Frogs are now guaranteed to appear on Space lands. I hope.
2017-05-29: Working on fanon aspect list. Right now, it's "everything from Sburb Glitch FAQ plus Sky and Snow, for thematic reasons" because Rain and Stars need pairs.
