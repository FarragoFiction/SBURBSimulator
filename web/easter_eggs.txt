<h1> Definitely well-hidden Easter Eggs. (Mini-Update for 4/13/17)</h1>
<p> Easter eggs can be combined as such: 'index2.html?seed=SEEDID&lollipop=true&sbajifier=true'.  Start with a question mark after index2.html, and then for each new easter egg have an ampersand.  Here there be dragons. These are easter eggs, not main features. Shit can get weird.  I want to stress that each of these easter eggs are 100% modifiers to the real sessions. You can look at a session where everybody died and add a lollipop to it to see if it makes things better. One big exception is the seed easter eggs, like 612 or 413. These easter eggs straight up override the native players (and create some wholesale if there aren't enough players). So there's nothing to compare it to.</p>

<p> Hall of Fame is officially closed as of 6/12/17. </p>

<p><a href = "index2.html?seerOfVoid=true">Seer of Void</a>: A button will display on screen, pressing it allows you to peer into the Void. What mysteries are within??? (ProTip: not all Sessions have void players in them). </p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?pen15=ouija">Pen15 Ouija</a>: What!??? Who let all those void players have markers???</p>

<p><a href = "index2.html?royalRumble=true">Royal Rumble</a>: Everyone is an Heiress, which means they have a biological imperitive to kill each other. Also, a much higher rate of fish puns.</p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?lollipop=true">Trickster</a>: Everyone enters the session at a stupidly high level, is in love with everybody else (except the heart player), has super annoying quirks (except the heart player) and instantly completes their land quests. You'd think death would be impossible in this mode, and you'd be right: Except for when the tricksters THEMSELVES go batshit. Holy fucking shit. Oh, and now Doom players are completely immune, not half-assidly immune like Heart players.</p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?babyStuck=true">BabyStuck</a>: Everyone looks like a Baby/Grub and is practically incomprehensible. Suprisingly cute, until the murders start happening, then surprisingly disturbing.</p>
<p><a href = "index2.html?sbajifier=true">SBAHJIFIER</a>: The graphics fuck up a LOT. Terrible outline artifacts are included (really proud of that), sprite layers are rendered offset, and I allow the page to randomize its own css. But the simulation itself is still working as normal. Oh yeah, besides everybody being given dunkass quirks.</p>
<p><a href = "http://www.farragofiction.com/SBURBSim/index2.html?seed=131199038&b=KQYQzMAcCioEzAJywKwgeYAhW6kBZgAGI4ARhQCpLyzjST67McBNe8gQXISIDZgYEB0aMw3FrgRZepfKTIKAYuWhA&s=DTBuEsBMFMHtoAQHMCGBbaBnYAXAFogEbhLIrRrAEA21KAUtAGZMjCY4rgBO2T3AVw7cUOcLEqYA7tGg4AQt1ht+0cADtImPOAAOwAJ7RqsKcH7homgOLQlaA0A?sbajifier=true">The most Canon possible SBAHJ session.</a> It is a refrance.
<p><a href = "index2.html?robot=true">RoboStuck</a>: Everyone looks like robots. Their relationships are initialized to neutral, because as we all know robots are tin cans incapable of feelings. (AB said it was ironically funny, I'm not REALLY Robo-Racist, I swear!). They also get a small power boost because robots are superior. They also TALK IN A LOUD MONOTONE. And...they say 'BEEP' sometimes. (They cannot control the beeps.) </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=413">Homestuck Beta</a>: The 8 human players, John all the way through Jake, play SBURB. Quirks/Character designs are approximate. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=111111">Homestuck Alpha</a>: The 8 human players, Jane all the way through Jade, play SBURB (i.e. post scratch kids enter first). Quirks/Character designs are approximate. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?home=stuck">Homestuck Randomizer</a>: Normal players randomly replaced with Homestuck human characters. For example, 2 Johns, a Jade, a Jake and a Dave might play a session. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=613">Hivebent Alpha</a>: The 12 Alpha troll players (Kankri all the way through Mituna) play SGRUB. If they manage to scratch, you'll instead get to see Karkat through Sollux. Quirks/Character designs are approximate.  I chose 613 because OpenBound is Act 6, Intermission 3. Or 6I3. Closest I could come up with an arc number for it.</p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?hive=bent">Hive Bent Randomizer</a>: Normal players randomly replaced with Alternian characters. For example, 2 Karkats, a Kanaya, an Eridan and an Aradia might play a session. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=612">Hivebent Beta</a>: The 12 Beta troll players (Karkat all the way through Sollux) play SGRUB. If they manage to scratch, you'll instead get to see Kankri through Mituna. Quirks/Character designs are approximate.</p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?open=bound">OpenBound Randomizer</a>: Normal players randomly replaced with Beforan trolls. characters. For example, 2 Kankris, a Porrim, a Rufioh and a Damara might play a session. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=1025">Cascade</a>: The 8 human players, John all the way through Jake, play SBURB along with 4 troll players. Quirks/Character designs are approximate. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?rumpus=fruity">Fruity Rumpus Asshole Factory</a>: Normal players randomly replaced with canon characters. For example, 2 Karkats, a Porrim, a Jake and an Aradia might play a session. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=33">Nepeta Quest</a>: 12 Nepetas play SGRUB.  Has a true random 50% chance of either being Karkat and friends all dressing up like Nepeta, or 12 Nepetas all roleplaying as Karkat and friends. Basically, either everybody is olive blood, or they are their regular blood colors. Either way everyone has the quirks and trollTags of Karkat and friends.</p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?nepeta=:33">Nepeta Quest x2 Combob!!</a>: All players in a session (remember, can pass a specific session ID as well) are either roleplaying as Nepeta or are being roleplayed as BY nepetas. True random. Drives AB crazy.</p>

<p> <a href = "index2.html?seed=88888888">SpiderQuuuuuuuuest</a>: 8  Vriskas play SGRUB and start an endless cycle of luck stealing. Probably. </p>
<p> <a href = "index2.html?luck=AAAAAAAALL">SpiderQuuuuuuuuest x2 Combob!!</a>: Turn any random session into a bunch of Vriskas.</p>

<p> <a href = "rare_session_finder.html?seed=030303">Guided AuthorBot</a>: Did you know you could pass  a seed to the AuthorBot? It will direct her to the FIRST session she looks at.  The SECOND session will be the natural child of the first (unless there is a combo session, in which case it gets wrapped into the first). In this way you can look at the 'geneology' of the sessions/frogs. </p>
<p><a href = "rare_session_finder.html?lollipop=true">AuthorBot Trickster</a>: Ask the AuthorBot to look through a bunch of Trickster Sessions.</p>

<p> <a href = "rap.html">Extended Rap Battles</a>: Okay, so, like the rap battles are just so amazingly shitty, right? And they only get even SHITTIER the longer I let them go on. So, you know, here's a page that's just the rap battles going on for much, much longer. It was the easiest way to test them without waiting for sims to run. </p>

<p><a href = "tools/">Development Tools</a>: A selection of tools made to help with SBURBSim development. Take a(nother) peek behind the curtain.</p>

<p>Is 'void' class a thing in CSS???  What could this mean??? <div class = 'void'> Do you think it has something to do with this??? A better question: Do you really think this would be an easter egg if this were the only place with a div hidden in void???</div> </p>
<p>DID YOU KNOW: In addition to sharing hair color/blood color with their guardians, players share at least one interest with them as well.  So a player might like Wizards and Writing while their Guardian might enjoy Wizards and Hacking.
<p><font color = "white"> Things like this won't be hidden if AB is in trickster mode. I find this hilarious. Some of the hints to this page were white font on a white page. There's actually tons of extra easter egg content throughout the site, mostly within the code itself, which understandably isn't a place your average Observer is gonna go rummaging around in.
I'm actually planning on having things like this for the void players, but hidden much better, with a display:none tag in html. But seeing how obnoxiously it shows up in trickster mode...almost makes me want to make it white font after all. A little extra bonus, void tricksters THINK they are being all sneaky, but aren't. Yes. This is hilarious.
</font> </p>

<p>IMPORTANT: TO GET BACK HERE: The easiest way to return here is to get AB to help you (she is the best).  Have her simulate a few sessions for you (shouldn't take much) and filter by "full frog" and "all lived" and then do a "find on page" for "better than expected" and you should find a session id that will get you back to this page. You are certainly welcome to reuse the password that got you here this time...but be warned that should I push an update to the server, that session might not go the same way, and it might not work forever.  If you have trouble (maybe none within a hundred sessions or so) finding a "better than expected session", don't hesitate to drop me a line. Half the reason I chose that as the passphrase  was to give me a hard incentive to make sure there still even WERE sessions that went well. I don't want to be a COMPLETE asshole creator over here.</p>

<p> <b>Never mind, there's an easier way to get in here, now.</b><br> <Br>
Oh god, oh god, I can't stop laughing. Normally this is the sort of thing I would post on tumblr, or the newpost page, or the glitch faq or some shit,
but all this stuff is a 'seeeecret', right???  So, KR wanted me to upgrade AB and ABJ to be able to search through easter egg sessions. And I agreed it would be
useful to be able to find grim dark tricksters on command (did you know that's a thing?).

But...see...the AuthorBot is pretty much the Sphinx guarding this password page, right? And I don't mean metaphorically. I mean literally. She checks the riddle answers.  So if you can slip the AuthorBot
bullshit giggle candy over on the RareSessionFinder, you can slip her the candy here. You know "?lollipop=true" in the url. And...something like 80% of sessions go "better than expected"
in trickster mode.  So, suddenly, the password for getting past the AuthorBot is "bribe her with candy and then lazily guess a few numbers." It's 100% in the spirit of trickster mode, who cares about doing things right and growing as a person, let's activate cheat mode and win!!!!!!!!!!!  Makes the hint phrase suddenly kinda ominous, right?
Where is everything better than expected? Where AB can be high as a fucking kite. Whatever, have fun getting back here easier: <a href = "index_pw.html?lollipop=true"> Give AB a Lollipop? (Enter the session id like normal, the lollipop wil be in the URL)</a>. Or I guess you can avoid giving her mind altering substances and just get here the old fashioned way. Your choice.
<br>Alternatively, it's kind of like AB installed her own haXOR style back door. Beautiful no matter how you look at it. And useful for all of us. I know I'M using it.
<br><br>
DID YOU KNOW: This now brings the count up to FOUR ways to get here. Via figuring out what the riddle is actually asking, via lucky guessing (or misunderstanding the riddle luckily), via hax0ring, and via roboBribing.
<br><Br>Also, you may notice that if you slip AB some candy, she is still in her original chassis. You might say she becomes........WASTED.
