            <h1> Development Tools </h1>
            <p>Seems you've found your way to the (not very) hidden page for SBURBSim's dev tools.
                They were written to assist further development post Great Refactoring, and for future plans which are going to need some of them.</p>

            <p>They might not make much sense if you don't know a lot about the sim's internals, but that's ok.
                They're mainly for us or anyone who wants to make a mod, but it seemed like a cool idea to leave them in as extra things to find.</p>


            <a href = "aspect_palette/"><h2>Palette Builder</h2></a>
            <p><span class="nyi">Very unfinished:</span> Will be a tool for creating, editing and saving palette files for the new sprite format. Currently the testbed for a new colour picker.</p>

            <a href = "stat_summary/"><h2>Class and Aspect Stats</h2></a>
            <p>The reference page for the internal values related to classes and aspects. It doesn't cover everything associated with them, but has most things you might want to know.</p>

            <a href = "wordgifs/"><h2>Gif Words</h2></a>
            <p><span class="nyi">Barely started:</span> Generates blown up text gifs for things like CORPSESMOOCH COMBOs and crazy Hope effects. Use this power wisely! Waiting on completion of a custom gif encoder.</p>

            <a href = "xml_editor/"><h2>XML Editor</h2></a>
            <p>A visual editor for XML files used as data around the sim. Currently only does FAQs, but will be expanded later.</p>
