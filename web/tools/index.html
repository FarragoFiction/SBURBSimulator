            <h1> Development Tools </h1>
            <p>Seems you've found your way to the (not very) hidden page for SBURBSim's dev tools.
                They were written to assist further development post Great Refactoring, and for future plans which are going to need some of them.</p>

            <p>They might not make much sense if you don't know a lot about the sim's internals, but that's ok.
                They're mainly for us or anyone who wants to make a mod, but it seemed like a cool idea to leave them in as extra things to find.</p>

            <a href = "image_tools/"><h2>Image Utilities</h2></a>
            <p>Currently allows creation of "special stardust"-like glitchiness and corruption in images.</p>

            <a href = "stat_summary/"><h2>Class and Aspect Stats</h2></a>
            <p>The reference page for the internal values related to classes and aspects. It doesn't cover everything associated with them, but has most things you might want to know.</p>

            <a href = "text_engine/"><h2>Text Engine Test Suite</h2></a>
            <p>The Text Engine generates recursive randomised text using a specialised word list format. This test suite allows testing of in-development lists with the engine without them needing to be pushed to the main site or having to have a working SBURBSim dev environment.</p>

            <a href = "text_tools/"><h2>Text Utilities</h2></a>
            <p>Generates blown up text gifs for things like CORPSESMOOCH COMBOs and crazy Hope effects, and shitty SBAHJ-style word art, complete with terrible jpeg compression. Use this power wisely!</p>

            <a href = "xml_editor/"><h2>XML Editor</h2></a>
            <p>A visual editor for XML files used as data around the sim. Currently only does FAQs, but will be expanded later.</p>
