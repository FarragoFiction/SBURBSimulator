<h1> Rare Session List </h1>
Heh heh heh.  Once upon a time it was outright HARD to find rare sessions.  "Oh woe is me", I would wail, "however shall I know if Jack is still flipping his shit like a goddamned asshole?".
Well. That is in the past, now that I have written my <a href = "rare_session_finder.html"> AuthorBot</a>.  She is capable of evaluating sessions at many times the speed of us puny meat bags.


<br><br> The below remains for archival purposes.  I enlisted you, the fans, to help me find rare sessions.  Thank you to everyone who participated, you helped me debug things to the point where the rare session finder could even exist in the first place.<br>
