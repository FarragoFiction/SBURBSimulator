        Like, you pick your class, aspect, and interests.
        and then within each of those 4 things, you answer quiz questions to pick a single theme out of it
        (or a couple if the quiz is going on too long)
        and then generate a land from it with picture, and description and
        a SHAREABLE URL so ppl can show off their lands. have the whole thing be canvas so they can save as png, too.
