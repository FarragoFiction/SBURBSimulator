This generally makes the session go differently, since the time player is now op as shit AND has different opinions about all their friends. <Br><br>Fun fact: This is officially the ONLY way to recover from a crash.  Time players should ALWAYS be able to nope the fuck out of a timeline.<br><Br>Haha, whoops I lied. Turns out Space4 gnosis lets you nope out of a crash as well, by escaping to another session. Good times. Frog magic is clearly best magic. <br><Br>Speaking of, Space4 theoretically lets you escape into your own scratch, Hussie Style.  But I couldn't test that code because it turns out the Space3 event p much makes you just win instead of scratch. AB can't even help me look because it's beyond her vision. So, like, if anybody finds a scratch while the infinite combo space4 shit is going, hit me up.

Nope. THIS time it was the OTHER thing those fucking cat trolls are known for: Shipping. <bR><br>Those handy dandy tool tips I made (where you mouse over a name to see their stats) basically made it so that shipping grids INVSIBLY were different every time, which made the shippers go into overdrive thinking they had new ships all the time.  Unless you told it not to render which would ALSO disable the tool tips. <br><Br> So for once, AB was right and REALITY was insane. Good times. <br><br>OMFG guess mind4 was way easier than I thought.

So, Hope players can childisly rename the class/aspect of whoever they hate, right?

If players have a sick frog, then the code checks their child session to see if the remaining living players can fit into it (max of 12 players in a session at a time). If so, they go on over.  Their child session is a real session that has it's own fate, and these alien players are disrupting that. When they join the session, it prints the ID out, so you could put that in a url to see how the sesion was supposed to go. Sometimes the alien players help, quite often they make things way worse. <Br><Br> These sessions are pretty rare, so I ALSO wrote the AuthorBot over there to look for rare sessions and report back.")
