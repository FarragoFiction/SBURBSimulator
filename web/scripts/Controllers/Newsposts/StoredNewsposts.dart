Observers gotta wait and do shit linearly though, cuz fuck you that's why. <Br><br> Once they get there, the tier4 player will give the Observer the option to reset the session, at which point the time player will murder their own past self and replace them as Alpha.  This generally makes the session go differently, since the time player is now op as shit AND has different opinions about all their friends. <Br><br>Fun fact: This is officially the ONLY way to recover from a crash.  Time players should ALWAYS be able to nope the fuck out of a timeline.<br><Br>Haha, whoops I lied. Turns out Space4 gnosis lets you nope out of a crash as well, by escaping to another session. Good times. Frog magic is clearly best magic. <br><Br>Speaking of, Space4 theoretically lets you escape into your own scratch, Hussie Style.  But I couldn't test that code because it turns out the Space3 event p much makes you just win instead of scratch. AB can't even help me look because it's beyond her vision. So, like, if anybody finds a scratch while the infinite combo space4 shit is going, hit me up. I wanna test it.<br><Br> Also, I might make it harder for time players in particular to get gnosis, cuz holy shit are they spamming it. ")

AB's been a LITTLE wonky lately, but it came to a head with ppl looking for Rage4 updates that just were not going the way AB said they were, even WITHOUT getting the gnosis 4. <br><br>After much wailing and gnashing of teeth and at least one Derse quest, it turns out that unlike every OTHER time AB has gone the RogueAI route, this time it wasn't because of randomness getting out of control (fucking cat trolls, I swear). Nope. THIS time it was the OTHER thing those fucking cat trolls are known for: Shipping. <bR><br>Those handy dandy tool tips I made (where you mouse over a name to see their stats) basically made it so that shipping grids INVSIBLY were different every time, which made the shippers go into overdrive thinking they had new ships all the time.  Unless you told it not to render which would ALSO disable the tool tips. <br><Br> So for once, AB was right and REALITY was insane. Good times. <br><br>OMFG guess mind4 was way easier than I thought. The assholes hax0r my YellowYard thing, but without my trade mark restraint and good sense. Enjoy crashing the session, assholes. ")

Hopefully this is going out first thing in the morning, tho. <br><Br>  And also hopefully I rewrite it with more energy.  Basically, Rage Gnosis4 is about gettin MAD that you are in a shitty simulation created by shitty people, and draggin them into it to get sweet sweet vengence. <br><Br>Haha fuck that took way more effort than I thought. Just gonna...deploy that shit.")

Which is to say that the laws of causality gets fucked up in a weird lovecraftian nightmare as everything inverts itself just for the sake of changing rules.

Hell, they even managed to figure out how to lie to AB.<Br><br>Light players do the opposite, drawing attention to themself at the cost of everyone else.  At least they make a little bit of the session stats visible. And you know, everybody gets SO LUUUUUUUUCKY!!!!!!!!  It's kind of funny when two light players fight over the spot light, tho.")

Wastes fuck with the rules of the sim and make her reports incredibly inaccurate.   So I have given her the ultimate act of diamond buddy trust, and have given her the power to UNDO any Wastes effects.   <br><BR>Functionally, this means that she won't apply one sessions' waste shit to the next session in the list, but that the Wastes changes WILL happen to their own scratch and combo and etc.<Br><Br>You should also find AB much faster after PL and me frantically cleared away a lot of shit that was slowing things down.")

They generally change basic facts about the session that they'd rather not believe in.<br><Br>The best possible bug happened while I was debugging it, tho.  So, Hope players can childisly rename the class/aspect of whoever they hate, right?  This resulted in me discovering that Aspects dont actually know what file their symbol is in, still using the outdated 'name.png' schema.   This resulted in the sim crashing because it could not find 'Dick.png'.  Best crash.")

It's so weird to me that I started up SBURBSim as a way to pass the time 'before Hiveswap' way back in January, and now here we are. Good times. <br><Br> Today I implented a basic 'grist' system that is required to breed a successful frog.  Otherwise one asshole with a FAQ was enough to basically guarantee victory.

It's important to remember that FAQs can be written by any classpect, not just Wastes.  Wastes just have a huge bonus towards meta shit.<BR><BR>I'm gonna be slowly adding the various faq entries while also doing bug fixes.  Once FAQs seem p close to finished (or I get bored) I'll start up the tier 3 gnosis events as well.")

Fun fact: I have WAY less power over this simulation than I thought. I can fiddle with godTierDestiny all I want, but ultimately it's Jack (or Murder Mode Players) who decide whether or not corpses get produced before the reckoning. Even giving 90% of players a godTierDestiny doesn't change survival or even the rate of god tiering very much. Bluh. All it does it increase the uselessness of 'They appear destined for greatness' messages. (Well, and, I mean, it increases the raw NUMBER of God Tiers, I'm sure, but I don't care about that. I wanted to decrease the number of sessions with no god tiers at all.) I'm gonna dial it back down to 50% destiny from 90%.
