	Hey! You're on the Main Branch now, where things should be more stable, less buggy and somewhat balanced.  I try to avoid updating it more than once a week (sometimes once a month), though updates might happen more frequent if a major bug is discovered.  Each time I updated the Main Branch you can expect sessions can go differently, as the code they are based on changes.
