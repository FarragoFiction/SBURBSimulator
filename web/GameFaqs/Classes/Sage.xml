    <section> <header> Question: Why do these other players keep nagging me about seemingly trivial nonsense? </header> <body> Chances are, you're the Seer or Sylph of the session, which means you basically have to herd your little flock to victory... lest they be caught in the theoretical jaws of the wolf. Their death is the exact opposite of what you need, as you need all the power you can muster to survive your session. If they try killing you, however, killing them instead is a free action. </body> </section>
