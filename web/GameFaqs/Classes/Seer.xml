    <section> <header> Question: Why do these other players keep nagging me about seemingly trivial nonsense? </header> <body> Chances are, you're the Seer or Sylph of the session, which means you basically have to herd your little flock to victory... lest they be caught in the theoretical jaws of the wolf. Their death is the exact opposite of what you need, as you need all the power you can muster to survive your session. If they try killing you, however, killing them instead is a free action. </body> </section>

    <section> <header> I just saw my friends die! But like...not infront of me in like the future? </header> <body> Welcome to the wonderful world of prophechy, that's what will happen if you don't make diffrent choices. So go save them. Also whatever you just saw still happens but in an alternate timeline where everyone dies because by changing it you make it inconsistent, but leave that to your time player to worry about. </body> </section>
