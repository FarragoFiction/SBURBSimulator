    <section> <header> Apparently I'm a Heir? Does that mean somebody in this weird place left my a bunch of money? </header> <body> No, you gotta earn your boonbucks like everyone else. However you will literally inherit the powers and traits of your Aspect. Don't worry about what that means and just keep on doing the things you do, you'll figure it out when you're meant too. Just be thankful you got a simple, usually-not-a-instant-lose Class! </body> </section>

            So, I'm an Heir, right? So how and where do I actually get my powers and aspect stuff?

            It's really hard to say, honestly. Sometimes you can gain your aspect from Skaia, from denizens, or from your fellow players. An Heir is "one who inherits [x]", but it's never really specified where you inherit [x] from. I guess when coming up with the Heir class, Skaia was literally just like, "Eh, I don't care how you inherit it, just inherit it!"
