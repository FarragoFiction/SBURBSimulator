    <section> <header> Apparently I'm a Heir? Does that mean somebody in this weird place left my a bunch of money? </header> <body> No, you gotta earn your boonbucks like everyone else. However you will literally inherit the powers and traits of your Aspect. Don't worry about what that means and just keep on doing the things you do, you'll figure it out when you're meant too. Just be thankful you got a simple, usually-not-a-instant-lose Class! </body> </section>
