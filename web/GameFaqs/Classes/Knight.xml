            Wait, what's this about frogs?

            Either you're the Space player, or a Knight.  Space player breeds the Frogs, Knight basically does a game long escort quest to help out.

            My friends keep dying, how am I supposed to be protecting them?

            Generally, the best way to protect your friends while playing SBURB is through whatever your aspect is.  Breath or Time or whatever the fuck.  Do a few quests on your planet and you'll get a feel for how it works.

            Uh, I heard that the Knight was supposed to help me breed frogs, but *I* am the Knight.

            Where does SBURB even come up with these shitty classes? What even IS a Knight?

        <body>
            I'm pretty sure it's like, narrative archetypes and shit.  Knights quest and protect and slay beasts and stuff.  Try doing that kind of stuff.

            WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE SO MANY QUESTS ON MY PLANET?
        </header>
        <body>
            Welcome to Knighthood, bro.  Quests are just something Knights do.  Get ready to help the Space player, too. Quests for days.

            I really fucking hate the Space Player.

            Suck it up.  Without them, you can't beat the game. Just try to ignore them and get their quests out of the way as fast as possible.
