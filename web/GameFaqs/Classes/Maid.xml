    <section> <header> Question: I am a Maid so what now ? </header> <body> A Maid? Well from what I understand a Maid of [Aspect] is one who creates/organises their Aspect.They will serve their Aspect but in doing so eventually...sort of have have their Aspect's Will in their Doing ? It is Complicated.Either way they(and you) also Embrace their Aspect,all the parts of it,like all the good and bad stuff. </body> </section>

        How can I best show my friends and enemies what I'm MAID of?

        Nice pun. But seriously, remember you can create your aspect, and that aspects are more then their literal interpretations e.g. Breath and Freedom.

            I bet you're a Maid.  Maids get to do various things that serve their aspect, up until they are high enough level to SERVE their aspect to their enemies on a silver plate of whoop ass.

            Hey, if you have ever seen the weirder costumes, you would not be complaining.  The wrappings look cool!

            If I'm the Maid of X, why is everybody else so much more full of X than normal?

            As a Maid, you serve your aspect to your friends.  You get some along with, but it's mostly something you give to others.
