    <section> <header> Question: I am a Maid so what now ? </header> <body> A Maid? Well from what I understand a Maid of [Aspect] is one who creates/organises their Aspect.They will serve their Aspect but in doing so eventually...sort of have have their Aspect's Will in their Doing ? It is Complicated.Either way they(and you) also Embrace their Aspect,all the parts of it,like all the good and bad stuff. </body> </section>

        Nice pun. But seriously, remember you can create your aspect, and that aspects are more then their literal interpretations e.g. Breath and Freedom.
