        My friend seems to really like messing up the code of this game! What are they even doing? I don't understand!

    <body>That is what tends to happen when people know enough about the game. Is your friend a Waste? If so, really not surprised here. When somebody understands the programming behind SBURB, they really just can't resist trying to break it. Could you? That's what I thought.

            Hey, uh, I get the feeling that these FAQs are just sort of being thrown together randomly.

            Wastes fuck shit up.  "Lay Waste to" in other words.  Good luck trying to steer that shit into not fucking over your own party too much.

            Holy fuck I keep leveling up but all that happens is I get slightly better at strifes.  My friends are getting all sorts of weird abilities. What gives?

            I'd be you're a Waste. Wastes 'waste' their aspect, until it's time to 'lay waste with' it. Try to just enjoy it while it lasts, you'll be nostalgic for this shit before you know it.
