    <section> <header> All my consorts keep calling me a thief, but I didn't even steal from them! ..Well not yet at least. </header> <body> Thief is the rest of your SBURB title. You remember how they also called you the "Hero of <Thing>?" Replace "hero" with Thief and there you go. As a Thief, you relocate your aspect (the [Thing] if you haven't already guessed that.) Mostly, you will be relocating inwards, in other words stealing it, but you also have the power to give. But lol why would you want to give, all of that [Thing] is rightfully yours! </body> </section>
