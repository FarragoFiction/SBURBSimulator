    <section> <header> Question: I'm a Witch. What do I do? Do I like... make potions and get burned at a stake or something? </header> <body> Witches are what I like to call Magical Problem Solvers. You'll get magic, then you'll get shit done. </body> </section> <section> <header> Question: Help! I don't have any magic! </header> <body> You'll get your flashy majjiks when you're good and damn ready. Just focus on your "Self Actualization" and commune with you Aspect and do quests and shit. And for the love of Duthulu don't kill anyone. </body> </section>
