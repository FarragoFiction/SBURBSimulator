    <section> <header> Question: I'm a Witch. What do I do? Do I like... make potions and get burned at a stake or something? </header> <body> Witches are what I like to call Magical Problem Solvers. You'll get magic, then you'll get shit done. </body> </section> <section> <header> Question: Help! I don't have any magic! </header> <body> You'll get your flashy majjiks when you're good and damn ready. Just focus on your "Self Actualization" and commune with you Aspect and do quests and shit. And for the love of Duthulu don't kill anyone. </body> </section>
    <section> <header> Question: The Witch just-just... MURDERED one of my friends! They were starting to act a little strange, the Witch said they needed to be dealt with, and then they just KILLED THEM! </header> <body> Yeah, Witches are problem solvers. However they tend to be a little...heavy handed. So if your friend was going Murder Mode or GrimDark then yeah. The Witch "solved" the problem

    <section> <header> Question: The Witch keeps flat out ignoring my Seer, and keeps doing all the things they say aren't possible. </header> <body> You know the saying "Rules are meant to be broken"? Witches sure do. </body> </section>
