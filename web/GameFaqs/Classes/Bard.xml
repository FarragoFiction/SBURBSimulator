            I'm supposedly a bard. What exactly does that mean?

            Everything's backwards, bro. You suck at what you're supposed to be good at and you excel at whatever you're supposed to be bad at. Stand proud, use those sticks and stones to build a castle or some shit.

    <section> <header> Screw this crap why am I the clown. </header> <body> Being the bard doesn't mean you're literally the clown.  One thing it means is you can destroy your aspect in yourself and others.  Like, let's say you're the bard of life and you see this guy just ignoring all the rules and trying to power through all their quests on strength alone that's totally going to get themselves killed for being a dumbass.  Well, it's your job to spray them with water and say down boy.  And no I am not talking about anyone in particular, VICTOR.</body> </section>
