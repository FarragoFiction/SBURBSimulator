            Why do my consorts seem to be so afraid of me?

            Welcome to Princehood!  As a "Destroyer" class you have a big bad rep to live up to/destroy utterly when you turn out to be a weenie.  Good luck!

            Wait...I am supposed to destroy my Aspect?
        </header>

            Well, it's not as simple as that.  Sure, you can go that route and end up the exact opposite of whatever the usual Hero of X is, but you can also destroy WITH your Aspect, and sort of embrace everything about it.

            You'd think it would be useful to have such a broad role, but it really only ends up being annoying as fuck without direction.

            I don't feel very much like a Prince.
        </header>
        <body>
            There's two main schools of thought here:

            1)  You don't know shit about what Princes are, and you actually really do fit it

            or

            2)  SBURB is gonna make you into a Prince whether you like it or not.

            Enjoy!

            ... Are these poofy asshole pants REALLY necessary?
        </header>
        <body>
            I've heard rumors that you can change up the god tier outfits, but have never found a way yet.  Just embrace the pants.

            What's with this headband thing?
        </header>
        <body>
            It's like....a cloth tiara.  Cuz you're a prince. Do princes even WEAR tiaras?  Has SBURB even ever seen a Prince?  The questions are endless.
