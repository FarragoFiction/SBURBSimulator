            How Bullshit is Dream?

            What gives, all of a sudden all my attacks suck!

            Dream is the aspect of creativity, and nothing kills creativity faster than soul crushing repetition.  Don't just spam the same attack over and over again, it will only get weaker each time.  Try something new!

            I ready this REALLY cool guide on how to make Dream OP, but none of it is working for me. Do I just suck?

            Yes. You really do, but now how you're thinking.  Dream is about originality and creativity, not about plagiarizing other people. Come up with something new.

            It seems that I have rolled Dream. What should I do?

            I am not telling you because that'll make whatever you do less effective.
