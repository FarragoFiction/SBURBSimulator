            Question: I am the Blood player! What does that mean?
        </header>

            Congratulations, you won the Skaian lottery ticket of bullshit and suffering to earn yourself your
            co-players falling under your jurisdication. Hope you like human interaction, because that is your life now.
            You get to do FUN activities such as dealing with other people's shit for an extended period of time, telling
            people to stop being such childish, pants pooping weenies, and being their personal caretaker, wow, fun.
            Make sure YOU keep their mental health stable, because we ALL know the psyche is such an easy thing to
            understand! You will be blamed for everything un-hinging off the fucking methaporical bullshit rotating door
            that is Sburb. Everything is suffering and pain, and that is in a sense literally what being a Blood player is all
            about. Truly, fuck you and your life. Welcome to Sburb, Hero of Blood, it does not take you kindly, but it is YOUR job to tell it to fuck off.

            Question: My friends are killing each other! I'm supposed to do something, right?
        </header>
        <body>
            Unless you want to fucking doom this timeline, you better haul ass over to where the genocidal cesspool is taking place right the fuck now. Of course, it is at this moment where you are supposed to see two dumbasses fighting it out for something stupid, I don't know and I don't care at this point. You shouldn't either. So while the rest of your friends are kicking back and grabbing their popcorns watching this giant shitshow take place and generally be completely fucking useless, it is now up to you to temporarily give a mild shit about why these dumbasses would rather the other one didn't live. Stand between the two of them and resolve this. Tell them why fucking murdering their friend is probably the worst possible idea they could have possibly produced from their brain. And if you truly are the Blood player, you would have no trouble finding a reason as to why their reason is stupid. Hell, at this point, it shouldn't even surprise you to find yourself inside a torrential mind downpour of reasons as to why their reason is completely fucking retarded. At this point you tell the useless spectators to fuck off. Once they have sufficiently fucked off, it is reccommended that YOU, once again, help them get through their weenie ass problems and help them forgive each other. Ew. But with bowls of chips eaten, bottles of soda empty, and a whole lot of fist bumps shared all around, your work here is done.
