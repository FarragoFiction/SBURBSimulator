            Kiss them. In SBURB, necrophilia is a power-up. If that's already happened, try taking them to their QUEST BED or SACRIFICIAL SLAB. It gives them a huge power up. If nothing happens at the bed, they're permadead. Sucks to be you, I guess. It's ok, you start getting blasé about it after a while. It happens to everybody.

            Tricksters
        </header>
        <body>
            So, I'm going to preface this by saying that the fact that you need to read this faq means a decent chance that you're screwed. I'm sorry, it's just a fact of life. This guide will help you to either maximize what little time you have left, or learn about preventing tricksters from attacking.

            So what is a trickster?
        </header>
        <body>
            Tricksters are probably the single most chaotic and malevolent entity that sburb can possibly produce. Seriously. A trickster can tank the black king, the black queen, hell, it could probably kill a debug NPC if it felt like it.

            Why wouldn't I want to be a Trickster, then?
        </header>
        <body>
            Imagine if you will looking out in horror as your skin turns to sugar and your brains into candy, as even as you speak your words become saccharine and your thoughts go mad, and you want it off but you can't resist it. If the answer to any of these questions was a yes, then get some help. If you are a trickster, you are not you. Tricksters care only about candy, "fun", and reproduction. If you manage to become one, any goals or relationships you had before you did are screwed.

            How do you become one?
        </header>
        <body>
            This is one that I really, really hesitate to answer. For the sake of avoidance, however, I will. In order to become a trickster, you need something with a certain intrinsic quality. We don't really know what it is, or what this quality is, only that it exists. My guess is that it's always candy, but I may be wrong. Ours was a massive jawbreaker. It had this sort of red and green swirl pattern, and the temptation of eating it was irresistible. You just have to eat it, or do whatever your body instinctively does when it touches the item. Other than that, just let yourself get kissed, kicked in the genitals, or something else weird by the trickster(s).

            What can a trickster do?
        </header>
        <body>
            Tricksters can do essentially anything. They can fly, create life, alchemize without grist, create grist, are basically invulnerable, have pretty much infinite strength and endurance, massive speed, know exactly what to say to hurt you, and are completely insane. They can do other stuff if they feel like it. One guy got trapped in a sort of infinite loop within a santa doll. He eventually went trickster, and the rest is history.

            How do you stop them?
        </header>
        <body>
            There are pretty much two ways to stop a trickster from attacking you. Death doesn't work, they'll just resurrect you, and god tiers can only hold them off for so long. No, the only ways to stop them are with a) a Zillyweapon, or b) outside interference. The first can be very rarely found through temporal shenanigans or normal quests, or through usage of the grist that tricksters secrete(?) called Zillium. Zillium can make Zillyweapons and some other weird stuff, which is all insanely strong. The weapons won't corrupt you, but too much zillium can, and it can be used to make a trickster item. Be on your toes if you ever find any. The outside interference part I've only heard about. Supposedly, some sort of outside force can end trickster corruption for good through time travel (not loops) or cleansing or something. Don't bet on that happening, though.

            Recognizing a trickster
        </header>
        <body>
            Tricksters have bright, neon hair and clothes, are covered in candy, weird skin (it disobeys the laws of reality somehow), and talk in a voice that can't be replicated. They will talk in a sugary sweet, sexually perverse, creepy as hell way. If you can see it, it can probably see you. Say your prayers.

            In conclusion
        </header>
        <body>
            Tricksters are undoubtedly a huge threat. Luckily, they're very rare and don't focus at all on finishing the game. If either of those were to be false, we'd be screwed. If you suspect someone of being a trickster, stay away, tell your friends to stay away, as well as any pets you may have. Try to get a Zillyweapon. Other than that, just pray that you don't get found.

            Question: Help! My hope player has gone crazy and is screaming about unlimited power!
        </header>
        <body>
            Ok first off, they aren't joking, their power level is literally infinite.
            Do you have a rage player? If yes they can just tank that shit and punch your hope player in the snout until they come back down to reality. If not you've got a bigger problem but basically every aspect but life has a few ways around Unlimited power use them to avoid the power crazed lunatic, hopefully(haha) they will calm down.

        </header>
        <body>
            That's corruption from the Others. In other news, they will ATTEMPT to crash the game. DO NOT LET THEM. That results in a session failure. If they're the space player, you're pretty much, i dunno, doomed, or something? Heard this from other sources, but some kind of, frog thing is made if the Grimdark space player manages to reverse the progress of the breeding TOO FAR.

            Question:How do you defend yourself from a Player Killer?
        </header>
        <body>
            Depends on the aspect, and whether they're able to be talked down. IF they can, just attempt to talk em down. If not, or the plan fails, go straight to killing. Get over it, and move on. Grab the pendant, and steal their laptop, and take over being the server player.

            Welcome to the battlefield. This is where you go after god-tiering. Now, you should probably find a way back to your land, and or contact your coplayers. Also, the carapaces on the Black Side will attempt to kill you. Don't let them.

            If magic is all we've ever known
            Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
            But I've seen miracles in every way
            And I see miracles everyday
            Oceans spanning beyond my sight
            And a million stars way above em at night
            We don't have to be high to look in the sky
            And know that's a miracle opened wide
            Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas
            And everything chilling underwater, please
            Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
            Long neck giraffes, and pet cats and dogs
            And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
            All in one room, together as equals
            Pure magic is the birth of my kids
            I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids
            The sun and the moon, and even Mars
            The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
            UFOs, a river flows
            Plant a little seed and nature grows
            Niagara falls and the pyramids
            Everything you believed in as kids
            Fucking rainbows after it rains
            There's enough miracles here to blow your brains
            I fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco bay
            It tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away
            And music is magic, pure and clean
            You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen

            Music is all magic
            (Are you a firm believer in miracles)

            (Do you notice and recognize miracles)

            Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling
            And it fills the room, from the floor to the ceiling
            I see miracles all around me
            Stop and look around, it's all astounding
            Water, fire, air and dirt
            Fucking magnets, how do they work?
            And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
            Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed
            Solar eclipse, and vicious weather
            Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
            And I love my mom for giving me this
            Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted(edited)
            I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
            Miracles ain't nothing to lie

            And my little boy looks just like daddy

            To witness them without explanation
            Take a look at this fine creation
            And enjoy it better with appreciation
            Crows, ghosts, the midnight coast
            The wonders of the world, mysteries the most
            Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
            To ignore the miracles of every day

        <body>
            Ever seen in fairy tales how witches rewrite the story and all it's rules then kinda are irrelevant? It's like that.
            Mechanically witches have a second hidden pluck bar which is HUGE like 1000x what it should, but they can only tap it when it's like 2-300+x their normal bar and it only fills up from overflow of their normal bar.

            The frog is the lotus of your session, it symbolizes your creation. The purple lotus represents openness to enlightenment, by seeking the purple frog you are showing the enlightenment offered by the horror terrors.

    <section> <header> Question: What does going "God Tier" mean? Is it a kind of power boost? </header> <body> No. Just, no. God-Tiering is not a power boost, it is a complete transformation, a metamorphosis of mind, body and soul. It is not to be taken lightly. It is like a baptism of fire and fury, your soul laid bare to the full power of your Aspect. And if you think you understand your Aspect, that you got it "under control" you can't be more wrong. If you really want to do it, and if you find out how to do it, because you will only learn of it if you are meant to. Then you will lay down a child with the makings of a Hero and rise a hero with the makings of a God. </body> </section>
    <section> <header> What is this little ball thing that keeps following me around? (Sorry if this is obvious, I just started...) </header> <body> That "little ball thing" is your Kernelsprite.

It is recommended you prototype something sentient [or something that was sentient, it can resurrect things!] to be your guide. However, beware prototyping something too powerful, as all enemies you will ever face will gain the powers and abilities of the prototyped object. </body> </section>

    <section> <header> So what's all this about a Black Queen? </header> <body> So you know how in some games, there are secret bosses? Stupid amounts of power, a ton of abilities, probably wipes out your party, maybe even more than once? It's exactly bit like that, but it isnt very optional and this not so secret boss has a chance of being made into not a boss which might be the most preferable situtation for you. Sometimes you might be able to get her to take off the ring, usually by prototyping some kind of amphibian, or maybe even get shenanigans or an uprising to kill her or at least un-ring her, if not you will have to fight her. The Black Queen has a lot of things you should watch out for: she's got all your prototypes stored up in her thanks to the ring, giving her their power and abilities, and she's got the Red Miles, also thanks to the ring. You can't escape the Miles. You can try but you just can't. Good Luck. </body> </section>
    <section> <header> Help! Meteors are falling everywhere! How do I get in this game already! </header> <body> First off, dying from a meteor is probably better than being in this game, but if you really want to, get your server player to place down the free buildings, the Cruxtruder, Punch Designex, Totem lathe, and Alchemiter, along with the pre-punched card. With all of those placed down, you need to open up the Cruxtruder, which requires a lot of force, so get your server player to drop something heavy on it, that usually works. A long cylinder should come out, along with some glowy flashy sphere and a countdown on the Cruxtruder.The countdown is how long you have to do all these random things until your death by fiery meteor, that cylinder is called a Cruxite Dowel, and the flashy thing is the Kernelsprite. Make sure you toss something into that thing before you enter the session, preferably NOT something extremely powerful, or else your session is screwed before you even start. I know this is really tedious, but next, take that Dowel and the Pre-Punched card and stick them into the Totem Lathe. That should cut the dowel into a new shape, the Cruxite Totem, which you can put into the Alchemiter to get some sort of Cruxite Artifact, which is different for each person. Using or doing whatever the Artifact wants you to do will put you into the session. Good luck. </body> </section>
    <section> <header> Question: What does the Jumper block do? </header> <body> The jumper block can connect to the alchemiter to allow for some level of customization. While this can be easily exploited to make alchemy MUCH more convenient, you should be careful with what you use. One player in my session tried to use it in conjunction with a glass of water, and pretty much turned the entire device into water. They were left with a very wet house, no way to do alchemy, and lost some perfectly good capchalogue cards. </body> </section>

            I've just installed SBURB, but its not doing anything.
        </header>
        <body>
            SBURB isn't a game you can play alone*. Once installed, you can choose to either play as a Server or a Client player. It doesn't matter which you choose. You'll eventually play both, whether you like it or not.

            *typically. Some people claim that it's been done before. Probably just another bogus rumor, though. I wouldn't try it.

            What is the difference between a Server and a Client player?
        </header>
        <body>
            It's actually pretty self explanitory. A Server player Hosts a Client Player in a session. The Client player connects to a Server Player. What ISN'T self explanitory is the duties of both players; A Server Player is required to add constructions and modify the Client Player's home in order to prepare them for entry into their Session. Meanwhile, it's the Client Player's duty to actually enter.
        </body>
    </section>
    <section>
        <header>
            Alright, I'm a Server Player. Now what?
        </header>
        <body>
            Once your Client connects, you should be able to see them on your screen along with menus for adding constructions. There's a few objects you'll want to add as soon as possible. The Cruxtruder, The Alchemiter, the Totem Lathe, the Punch Designix and the Pre-Punched Card are the most important. They should be free to build, but the more Clients and Servers you have connected to your session, the more objects and add-ons will be available. For now, just focus on placing the objects listed above and get ready for the game to begin.

            Remember when I said you can modify the player's home? You can do that. From the Menus, you should be able to select the option to create more rooms. Just click and drag where you want to expand and viola. More floorspace! The walls and ceilings will adjust to fit, so don't worry about that. You can also add and remove doors, windows, stairs, and walkways! Pesky Furniture in the way? Click and drag it to another room! Toss it on the roof, who cares? I'm sure that priceless family portrait would look great hanging on the front door.

            Did you also place the Alchemiter, Totem Lathe, Punch Designix, and the Pre-Punched Card? If no, DON'T TOUCH THAT YET. If yes, then strap in. Shit is about to get real! The Cruxtruder can be opened by applying significant force to the cap on the top of that little pipe jutting up from the center of the machine. Once you pop the lid on that soda-can, a couple things will fly free: The Cruxite Dowel and the Kernel Sprite*. Have your player take that Dowel and bring it to the Totem Lathe.

            The Totem Lathe looks like something I saw on TV...
        </header>
        <body>
            It's a Lathe. It carves Totems. In SBURB, Totems act like 3D Barcodes for the Alchemiter to create objects with. There should be a Punch Card Slot on the side of the machine. Instruct your player to place the Dowel on the Lathe and insert the Pre Punched Card into the slot. The Lathe will carve the Dowel for you to use on the Alchemiter. Oh, and seriously insist on your player hurrying up. You have more important things to worry about than carving tons of totems right now.

            The Alchemiter looks neat. How do I use it?
        </header>
        <body>
            The Alchemiter is the machine that will allow you to create items and objects to be used in SBURB! There should be a pedestal with a weird geometrical design on it. If you place any carved Dowels on that pedestal, the Alchemiter will scan it and create the object designated by the Dowel's shape. Each Dowel is unique, based on the Punch Card used to make it. Tell your player to put the Dowel you made using the Pre Punched Card on it and get ready to enter.

            Oh right. The Meteors. I forgot to mention the Meteors.Yeah sorry for dropping the ball on that one. Meteors, dude. Remember when you opened the Cruxtruder? There should be a timer on it that's counting down. That's pretty much how long you have until your player's smashed by a big rock from the sky. That's why shit was getting real.

        </header>
        <body>
            No no. Well... I don't know, maybe? That's the Kernelsprite. If it's bothering your player, it means it wants to be Prototyped. Toss something in and it should transform and calm down a little. You can only prototype a sprite twice, so make it count. Some people like to toss in meaningful things, and others just toss in whatever. It really doesn't matter, just so long as you actually do it. You MUST prototype the Kernel at least ONCE before you enter though, or else the game is going to go bonkers. You can do it twice before entry too, but I hear it makes the game harder...

This is probably because you are in a doomed timeline. If you aren't the time player, I advise making peace with your god. You're screwed by skaia. If you are the time player, this is probably all your fault. But don't give up hope! It's also your job to fix it. Just travel back in time and try and make sure the players don't screw up then. Of course, this might be the way the timeline is supposed to go, in which case traveling back in time will only screw stuff up worse. Gee golly time sure is the shittiest aspect. </body> </section>

            Unfortunately for you, there are only two ways out of this.

            1: Win.
            2: Die.

            I'm not sure if you've tried to take the second way out, but it doesn't work. Not as long as you want it. So you have to play, because it's the only thing you can do, and if you don't, then the game has plenty worse ways to make you suffer other than death.

        <body>
            Don't want to spoil it for you, but if all goes as planned, this game's ending will be the best of any game you've ever played. Except, well, it's not really a game. What you need to know is that if you decide to give up now, you will just let yourself down, you will let everyone else down. The very nature of the game requires that all players cooperate toward achieving a singular goal or else chaos ensues. By giving up, you are essentially giving the biggest middle finger possible to everyone else in the game.

            Frankly, depending on how far you got before this happened, you don't have much a chance at winning the game. One option is that you're in a doomed timeline, and in that case, there isn't much you can do. I've heard some people try talking to their Denizen, if it's still alive, and it can rarely provide you with an option that will help out some other instance of you in another frame of existence.

            However, in the event that you're not in a doomed timeline... well, sucks to be you, eh? Better find something to occupy your time, because you're likely to have a lot of it. It's not forever, oh no, trust me, but you're going to need to find something to keep your mind busy, fast.

            OH NO: I'm the last living player and am getting kind of bored of bike stunts. What now?
        </header>
        <body>
            First of all, no one can ever get bored of bike stunts. Ever. That's just a thing that doesn't happen.

            In the event that you have managed to get bored of bike stunts, congratulations. You're a statistical anomaly. Now, I hate to break it to you, but yeah, you don't have forever. Eventually an event called the Reckoning will occur, and all those meteors floating in Derse's orbit will start flying toward Skaia. Since you're the last one alive, it's pointless for me to tell you why this is happening and what it means.

            What is important, however, is that by the Reckoning's end, Skaia is destroyed, including the Battlefield. If you had maybe a 0.0001% chance of victory before, it's 0% now. You cannot win without Skaia. The Army of Darkness has succeeded in their mission, however suicidal it may have been.

            However, basically unknown to anyone at all (trust me, you won't find much about this any of Prospit, Derse, or your land's libraries) is that at the center of the Battlefield, far beneath its chessboard surface, there is a bomb. It varies in size from session to session and doesn't seem to correlate to any known variables. In some sessions it can fit in the palm of your hands, in others it's the size of a skyscraper. Regardless of size, this bomb is powerful enough to completely obliterate your session. It will go off as soon as the game detects that the Reckoning is complete.

            In short, you're done for. No way around that.

        </header>
        <body>
            Well, that ying-yang looking thing is the most lethal bomb known to man, consort, and carapace. Don't try using it, or alchemizing it into anything, because it never ends well. This bomb is designed to completely obliterate your session and everyone in it should things ever go awry. So yeah. You're better off just leaving that thing where you found it, because you wouldn't want to set it off accidentally, would you?

            Now, I have heard rumors of ways to dispose of this bomb, but no matter how hard you try, this thing will inevitably detonate. That doesn't mean it has to detonate inside your session, however. I once heard a story about a group of players who took the bomb, put it on a Skaian Battleship, then flung that thing Out of Bounds. I'm not sure what happened after that, but I assume that the bomb must have exploded somewhere in deep space, or some unlucky kids got a face full of session-shattering-kaboom. Either way, the group that did the disposing never had to worry about the bomb ever again.

            Oh yeah, and that group may have been mine, and that story may have been on the wall in one of the ruins on my Land. Prophecies, eh? Gotta love 'em.

            Well, clearly it means that a bunch of kids are going to die in your session. Them's the breaks. However, a lot of the time these paintings, engravings, or statues, however they may appear, are intentionally vague. Sure, a bunch of kids are going to die in your session, but maybe they're not your players. Maybe some other players show up, and all get slaughtered by whatever it is that lives beyond the session's boundaries just minutes before crossing it.

            So please, do remember to analyze your prophecies carefully. Or, you could just ask a Seer, or a Hero of Doom.

        <body>
            That's a great question. As a Hero of Blood, your powers will be put to their best use when in charge of a group. Whether this group be consorts, players, hired underlings, or carapacians, you're the best. If you've sufficiently advanced along your quest, most consorts will recognize you as being the hero of the land. Some may ask for you to complete a quest first, but none of these quests are too hard. The problem is that not all consorts who are easy to find are the best for your party. Sure, you could lead a party of a thousand weak consorts, but as a group gets larger it also becomes harder to manage. You'll want to look for rare consorts with special titles. Those guys can dish out insane amounts of damage that is only further multiplied by your powers.
