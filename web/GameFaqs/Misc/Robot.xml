    <section> <header> I would be freaking out, but this new body doesn't have an emotional subroutine. Should I install one? </header> <body> I wouldn't recommend it. You're best without those pesky distractions. Don't mind your "friends" telling you that you're different now. You don't need them. </body> </section>

            Question: I died right before I got into the Medium, and got a robot body. Now I don't have emotions?
        </header>
        <body>
            If you were like me, you felt that way before being a robot. Just pretend so that people you care about stop telling you that they miss you being alive. They need to realize that you're still cool.

            I went to the Alchemy station, and then I woke up and I was a robot?

            Ah, classic teleportaton problem.   Your fleshy self must have decided to captchalog themselves some how (brain in a jar is a popular method) and then combine themself into a robot.   Since you have all the memories of your original self, you get to experience the weirdness of having all their memories up until you split.

            I advise you focus on how much you've gained rather than worry about what you've lost.
