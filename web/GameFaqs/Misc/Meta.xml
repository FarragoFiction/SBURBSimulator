            Faceless dolls who communicate entirely through failing the turing test.

            Wait.

            You were serious. Uh.

            The consorts say I have the Denizen.... JavaScript?  What is up with that.
        </header>
        <body>
            console.log("I sure hope you like typos!")

            console.log("Because the Denizen JavaScript is gonna be full of them");

            console.log("And you get to spend a bullshit amount of time finding all of them before you can even BEGIN to fight your true Denizen.")

            if(player.aspect == "Viod") console.log("But at least whole sections of your denizens quests can never even happen.")

            Apparently I have the Denizen....  Hair7?
        </header>
        <body>
            JR Hacks the FAQ:  Lololool.

            Okay.   Hold on. Let me just....take over for a bit.

            Hair7 is my personal nemesis, enshrined as a Denizen for all time. It is the stupidest possible bug, and yet it keeps coming back.  I accidentally archived Nepeta's hair as 'Hair7.png" and not "hair7.png" and no amount of effort and yelling could convince the archive to remember the true name for very long.

            And yes.  Nepeta breaking the sim is canon. AB's irrational hatred is justified.

    <section> <header> Question: What is "Duthulu"? </header> <body> Shit! Who told you about that!? I... I mean uh. There is no such thing and anyone you tells you different is insane and likely to go Murder Mode any minute. I advise you to kill them as quickly as possible. Multiple times. </body> </section>

    <section> <header> Question: I beat my Denizen, have I beat the game? </header> <body> No, hell no. Even if your session went better than most then you still have two eldritch monstrosities to fight! And if you found this FAQ then you are definitely not in one of those sessions. So prepare for the next ultimate boss fight, the next monster will actually want to win. </body> </section>

            Question: My denizen is just a title what do i do?!?!
        </header>
        <body>
            Answer: [Critical Threat] You know how Wastes lack restraint? Well, JR and PL kinda sorta got into the source code of the game and added something a little... narcissistic in.  KR, of course, was pissed as hell.  These denizens are POWERFUL.

            Question: What is the pink frog?
        </header>
        <body>
            The frog is the lotus of your session , a thing a sacred beauty formed from the muck of you and your dumb society. The pink lotus is the perfected lotus, were your frog to be a pink frog it would then be a perfect universe. I do not believe such a thing is possible.

            Um. What was "The Great Refactoring"?
        </header>
        <body>
            Apparently SBURB used to be written in JavaScript, which let it get away with some sick nasty shit.  At some point one of the MetaPlayers decided that JavaScript was too much of a giant piece of shit, so they converted everything to a different language.

            This set all sessions on fire for awhile (sucks to be them), and then  afterwards the timelines were WAY more stable.

            Who is "The AuthorBot"?
        </header>
        <body>
            Every so often sessions have this weird robot show up.  She doesn't seem to do anything, she just watches, and if you go up to her, she'll say something about not being allowed to alter timelines.

            That said, I HAVE heard that sometimes meteors reign down on anybody who messes with her? Better to stay away.

            Uh.

            Fuck.

            Okay.

            Like.

            Don't Panic.

            But.

            You're fucked. You are so fucked.  Sessions only have the little girl scout robot show up if they are beyond saving. I'm talking total party wipe, do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars.
